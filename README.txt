Jink Operating System & Kernel
===============================
Here is the source code of the Jink Kernel.
See AUTHORS.txt for list of authors.
===============================
Build Instructions:
  - First you need a UNIX based system. (Linux/BSD/UNIX...)
  - You need to have coreutils, binutils, a assembly compiler and a c-lang compiler. 
  - By default asm compiler is nasm, and c-lang compiler is i386-gcc -> see jink-system/i386-gcc to get a x86 cross compiler to build Jink.
  - Then Type 'make' to build the kernel.
